# Image Processing and Classification Notebook

This notebook demonstrates essential image processing tasks and implements a classification model to distinguish between cat and dog images. Utilizing libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization, it also includes a machine learning model that predicts image classes and evaluates its accuracy.

## Contents

1. **Library Imports**  
   The notebook imports essential libraries:
   - **NumPy**: For handling and manipulating numerical data arrays.
   - **Matplotlib**: For visualizing image data and plotting transformations.

2. **Image Loading**  
   The initial step involves loading an image file, which is then used throughout the notebook for various processing and classification tasks. Ensure the image file is accessible, and update the path if necessary.

3. **Image Processing Operations**  
   The notebook includes transformations applied to the image, such as:
   - **Scaling**: Adjusting image dimensions or resolution.
   - **Filtering**: Applying filters like edge detection, blurring, or sharpening.
   - **Color Adjustments**: Modifying color balance or converting color spaces.

4. **Image Classification**  
   The primary feature of the notebook is a classification model for identifying cats and dogs. This model:
   - Processes and transforms image data into a suitable format for the classifier.
   - Trains a model (if applicable) to distinguish between cat and dog images.
   - Evaluates accuracy, providing insight into the modelâ€™s performance on the dataset.

5. **Visualization**  
   The notebook uses `matplotlib` to display original and processed images, as well as the model's classification results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, plus any machine learning library used (e.g., `tensorflow` or `scikit-learn`).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and ensure the notebook and image files are in the same directory.
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
   Install machine learning libraries as needed:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow  # or scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image-cat-or-dog.ipynb
   ```
4. Run each cell sequentially to process, classify, and visualize the images.

## Classification Model

The classification model is designed to distinguish between cats and dogs with an accuracy metric reported at the end. Experiment with different parameters and observe how they affect the accuracy to refine model performance.

## Acknowledgments

This notebook serves as an introductory guide for image processing and classification tasks using Python, ideal for learners or developers interested in exploring basic transformations and machine learning-based image classification.
